 ## Challenge 1
 Challenge 1 uses the Collatz sequence that takes and even or odd integer and performs continuous calculations until the calculations result in the number being set to 1. In this challenge I use a WHILE loop because the amount of times needed to iterate is unknown because of 1. User input being taken for the number and 2. Larger numbers will need to go through more steps which cant be predicted without hardcoding for a specific integer. 
 ## Challenge 2
 Challenge 2 is a prime number checker, it takes a user entered number and divides it by each number in a range from 2 to the entered number minus one. In this challenge I used a for loop because each number checked is within a range and has no need to exceed the given range, the loop iterates through each number and if it finds that the entered number is divisible by one of those numbers then it outputs that the number is not prime and breaks the loop, else it outputs that the number is a prime number.
 ## Challenge 3
 Challenge 3 generates a multiplication table showing the products of numbers 1-10. In this challenge I also used FOR loops because its best for making a table, especially when we know our table ranges. The first FOR loop goes through each row 1-10, and nested in that is another FOR loop that calculates the product of the current row number and the column number in the range 1-10. After it finishes iterating through all the columns it prints a new line before iterating through the next row.
